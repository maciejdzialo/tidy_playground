The goal of this repo is to collect code through which I learn and practice my craft as an analyst. Majority of datasets used in this repo may come from TidyTuesday repo: [https://tidytues.day](https://tidytues.day) and whenever possible I avoid re-uploading the data into my own repo. Instead, I try to create a dataset loading/downloading script that will help me to keep the data locally, mainly for offline use.
